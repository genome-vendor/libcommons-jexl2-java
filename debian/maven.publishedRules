# Maven published rules - additional rules to publish, to help
# the packaging work of Debian maintainers using mh_make
# Format of this file is:
# [group] [artifact] [type] [version]
# where each element can be either
# - the exact string, for example org.apache for the group, or 3.1
#   for the version. In this case, the element is simply matched
#   and left as it is
# - * (the star character, alone). In this case, anything will
#   match and be left as it is. For example, using * on the
#  position of the artifact field will match any artifact id
# - a regular expression of the form s/match/replace/
#   in this case, elements that match are transformed using
#   the regex rule.
# All elements much match before a rule can be applied
# Example rule: match any dependency whose group is ant,
# replacing it with org.apache.ant
#   s/ant/org.apache.ant/ * * s/.*/debian/
#net.java.dev.javacc javacc jar debian
